It provide developers with an easy to use commandline interpreter interface 
which allows them to search python packages and install them instantly.


### Usage

* Clone the project repository
* Enter the repo directory
* Run `python3 .` to get into the interpreter.

  command populates the `db` with fresh list of python packages. You should also consider
  running this command if you need to fetch fresh list of packages.
* At the interpreter, you can type any package name and press `Tab` for autocomplete feature.
* Once you find the required package, type its name and press `install package_name` to install package
* Type `help` for the other commands
